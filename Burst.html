          <!--The  challenge-->
          <h2>The Challenge</h2>

          <p><a href="https://burst.shopify.com/" target="_blank"><u>Burst</u></a> is a stock photography website created by Shopify to help merchants discover quality photos without having any legal repercussions when using it. However, with the recent success of the website we discovered there came a challenge when we had an influx of new contributors. In the beginning, Burst did not give these contributors access to their photos and they would have to email the Burst team to make any changes they would like. <b>How might we enable users to be able to manage their account and their content creation?</b></p>

          <ol>
            <li>1. Understanding Burst's process on how to become a contributor</li>
            <li>2. Understanding the contributor on what are their biggest pain points </li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <hr class="solid">

          <!--approach-->
          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <br>
          <p>As the sole product designer on the team, my first step was to understand our products and speak with the Burst team to see what steps they take to approve contributors, as well as collect common feedback they might have received from them. This included user research, a heuristic analysis of the current platform, as well as a competitive analysis. </p>
          <p style="font-weight:bold; color:#32a8a8;font-size:16px;line-height:20px;">User Research - Understanding the quality control measures of Burst</p>
          <p>To understand how social sellers connect with their customers I first signed up to all the popular groups on Facebook. Facebook is widely used for domestic dropshipping as social sellers find it easy to attract more people in their area as well as other states in their country. </p>
          <p>The one major thing Burst takes pride in is their quality over quantity, which means that each of the team members go in and manually choose and approve photos to be uploaded onto the Burst platform, as well as enter a short description and tags. This is a very time consuming process, but required to keep the quality high on the website.</p>
          <p> In regards to a contributors experience, speaking to the contributors we learned that they like feeling proud of their work by keeping it updated. With the current model of Burst, they were not able to freely edit the content they had and found management difficult, leading to a non-active community on the Burst platform. </p>
          <p>To have active engagement on the platform, we really needed to find a solution that would help contributors to do they major tasks that they like. After speaking to around 10 contributors, we learned that the major task they wanted was editing their live profile (being able to choose the hero image), having the ability to delete photos that they did not want to keep (whether this was because they didnâ€™t like the photo, or whether someone else was in the photo and asked them to remove it), as well as being able to add a location tag. The location tag was also a major concern for the Burst team, since contributors were not able to provide a description they would have to research and try discovering themselves where the photo might have been taken, which at the end also impacted SEO. </p>

                        <p>To understand the user flow, I did a heuristic analysis to see how contributors were approved or rejected and how they would continue uploading photos. I first started by looking at the <a href="https://burst.shopify.com/become-a-contributor" target="_blank"><u>Burst Contributor Guidelines</u></a>.</p>
                        <p>The first flow was trying to become a contributor. Users in this step can upload up to 10 photos for submission for approval, and fill out their information that they would like to have on their public profile if approved, this included a short description, any portfolio links, email, as well as a username on Burst. </p>
                        <p>Once the Burst team has evaluated the submission according to their <a href="https://burst.shopifycdn.com/content/BurstSubmissionGuide.pdf" target="
                          "><u>guidelines</u></a> the contributor is either sent an email in regards to whether they have been approved or rejected.</p>

                        <p>If approved, contributors are sent a unique URL where they can use to submit more photos (up 50 per submission). </p>
                        <p>When I reached this point I understood another thing that might be impacting engagement on the platform was not being able to find this unique URL, and having to further email the Burst team to send it again. Contributors definitely did have a username, but that would also be difficult to remember if they were not active on the platform. </p>
                        <p>Another problem was that users at this point can mass submit any amount of photos without actually checking for their own quality, in hopes that at least one more of them will be approved. This in turn impacts the Burst team who will have to manually check each photo. </p>

          <p style="font-weight:bold; color:#32a8a8;font-size:16px;line-height:20px;">Key Touchpoints</p>
          <ol>
            <li>1. Contributors were not able to manage their content once it had been approved and uploaded onto the Burst website</li>
            <li>2. Contributors would need to bookmark the unique URL in their email to be able upload more photos</li>
            <li>3. To receive any information regarding their account such as stats, they would need to email Burst to retrieve that data. </li>
            <li>4. Burst has strict guidelines for quality control<li>

          <p style="font-weight:bold; color:#32a8a8;font-size:16px;line-height:20px;">Competitive Analysis</p>
          <p>The two most popular stock photography websites that I looked into are Unpslash and Pexels.</p>
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12">
                  <div class="left-text-content">
                      <div class="section-heading">
                        <p><b>Pexels</b></p>
                          <p>The one unique thing that I really liked about Pexel was that they differentiated accounts for a contributor vs someone who is just engaging on their platform to download images. This definitely would help differentiate between a regular user and a photographer. Knowing the intent of the user and their account, photographers can manage their account however they like but in addition also be able to view their stats on the photos they have uploaded. For a regular user, since stats are not important they can manage their liked collection.</p>

 <h2>Ideation - Brainstorming and Iteration</h2>
<br>
  <p>Looking at the research, I understood we definitely needed to create an account management tool such as user profiles for contributors. After discussing with my team members we only decided to keep profiles for contributors since they are the ones facing the biggest challenge in managing the content they provide Burst. </p>

  <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12">
          <div class="left-text-content">
              <div class="section-heading">
                <p>One of the things that I started looking into was whether we needed these contributors to have a Shopify account (more details in the Taler project). A Shopify account does not require a user to start a store with the platform, however if they wish they can open a store later on. However, I discovered that we would have an issue for quality control since we did not want just anyone to be able to sign up as a contributor. These users still were required to go through the form submission to either be approved or rejected, and since the Shopify Identity account can be accessed by anyone I decided to keep a username and password combination unique for just Burst Contributors. </p>

                <p>In my first iteration, I added all the necessities a user would need to manage their account. The one thing I really needed to make sure since this user account is very public facing, we stick to the quality control that Burst is known for. This means that when a user is updating their hero image for their public profile they would only have access to their approved photos from Burst and cannot upload photos from their desktop or somewhere else. This also would help avoid any legal issues in case someone used an image that they didnâ€™t have permission to upload. </p>

                <p>Another pain point that users faced was deleting photos and editing their content. To further help users understand which pictures they should keep or delete, we decided to also add stats as a feature within the profiles. This would help users understand what photos of theirs are popular on Burst as well as on The Shopify Admin where merchants use their photos to create themes. This would not only help them realize whether a photo is successful, but also help them upload similar photos that might be as popular. </p>
                <p>At the end of the day, a photographer would want to be hired and found as well. This means we definitely need to give an option to these contributors whether they would want their email to be public or not. </p>

  <p>If a contributor is not active on the platform, and would like to delete their account they should also be able to manage this without requiring them to email the Burst team to do it for them. Rather this should be something they can do freely. Account management was definitely part of the low-fi designs where they are able to change their email and password but also have the ability to manage the notifications they receive from Burst. Not only that, they would have two options to either delete their account permanently (this would purge all the information on Burstâ€™s system), or they can hide their account (this would keep their information such as the stats and the pictures, but everything will be hidden from public viewing including SEO).</p>

                          <p>Due to time constraints as well as technical debt on the code, we had to make some adjustments on the features we were hoping to ship. This included how users would manage their content. In the final version, users can still delete their content but instead of automatically deleting this would trigger an email to Burst, where they will have to delete it manually from the backend and once that is done, the contributor will receive a notification in their email. </p>
                          <p>Another one we had to put on hold was account deletion. Users can still update their password, but if they would like to update their email they would still require emailing Burst. However, since this is just the first iteration we hope to improve this in the next round when we receive more feedback on the features we have provided. </p>

              <p>Due to NDA I am not able to reveal our stats and how our new features are doing. However, a common feedback from our contributors is that they love how easy it has become to upload and manage their content!</p>

              <br>
              <p>One of the things that I would definitely love to get into is helping these contributors create stores on our Shopify platform. A lot of photographers love selling their digital prints and it would be amazing if we can enable them to do this easily and efficiently.
I think overall the project was quite successful, however I would definitely want to further look into adding the features we couldnâ€™t add in this first round. To increase user engagement, I would also love to add user profiles for regular users who would want to save collections and liked photos for their own purpose.
