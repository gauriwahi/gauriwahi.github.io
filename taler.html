          <!--The  challenge-->
          <h2>The Challenge</h2>

          <p><a href="https://www.taler.app/" target="_blank"><u>Taler</u></a> is a graphic making application that enables users to quickly select a template and create graphical content that they can promote on their social media accounts. The current state of Taler was giving users a very broken experience and causing an 80% bounce rate. <b>How might we create a stronger brand recognition with Taler that can help merchants and aspiring merchants promote their brand?</b></p>

          <ol>
            <li>1. Understanding the user journey of what are the most commonly used platforms merchants use to promote products</li>
            <li>2. Understanding how we might be able to improve the user experience and gain a larger trust battery with Shopify</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <hr class="solid">

          <!--approach-->
          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <br>
          <p>As the sole product designer on the team, my first step was to understand how our users were using the product, and what areas they were dropping off at the most, and what might their common frustration be when using our tool. This included user research, a heuristic analysis of the current platform, as well as a competitive analysis. </p>
          <p><b>As a lot of the work on this tool is ongoing, I have only focused on how we iterated on the branding and storytelling of the product.</b></p>
          <p style="font-weight:bold; color:#32a8a8;font-size:16px;line-height:20px;">User Research - Understanding how users perceived Taler and its intent </p>

          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12">
                  <div class="left-text-content">
                      <div class="section-heading">
                        <p>Taler started off as a very simple editing tool to create graphic content. However, since it started off as an experiment to understand the needs and requirements of aspiring merchants the look and feel of the app is completely different than Shopify’s brand. The only signifer at the time was a “powered by Shopify logo” available on the Footer. I worked alongside the data team and researchers to understand how many users from Taler knew what Shopify was, and whether we were sending out a strong message of how this might be helping users with their brand recognition. We sent out a survey to our users to understand how they were using this product and whether they knew about Shopify. </p>

                  </div>
                </div>
              </div>
              <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12">
                  <div class="right-content">
                    <a target="_blank" href="assets/images/shoplogo.png">
                    <img src="assets/images/shoplogo.png" alt="powerd by Shopify logo">
                    <p>Powered by Shopify logo</p>
                  </a>
                  </div>
              </div>
        </div>

          <p>Working with the data team we discovered some of our tracking was broken, but the one thing we could tell was that we had a significantly large bounce rate. Since our bounce rate was around 80% at the time, we were not able to gather enough feedback from our external user base. So I decided to do a <i>guerrilla test</i> with around 10 coworkers who had not heard of our product and decided to see their reaction and gather feedback. </p>
          <p>The majority of feedback I received was that they were not aware if this was a tool by Shopify. Another feedback that we received was about the user experience of the overall app. <b>However, since this project got split into two phases the UX experience when using the tool is under NDA.</b></p>

          <p>Phase 1 of the project was to be focused on fixing the user experience however due to technical limitations, we had to prolong that part. To increase the engagement of the platform, I, along with the my team decided to focus on the branding part of the mission and to help create a better story of how Taler can be used and how it will help the merchants, as well as connecting it to Shopify to help establish a brand. </p>
          <br>
          <p style="font-weight:bold; color:#32a8a8;font-size:16px;line-height:20px;">Heuristic Analysis</p>
          <p>Most of our user base comes in from organic traffic. We use keywords provided by the SEO team to understand what are the basic tools entrepreneurs are looking for. Due to that nature, I decided to focus on the first time experience on both desktop and mobile web. </p>
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12">
                  <div class="left-text-content">
                      <div class="section-heading">

                        <p>There are many ways you can enter onto Taler. If a user is looking for a graphic making tool, they would end up first on our landing page. This page only had minimum information, and was starting to present templates that users could use from the get-go. However, the one thing the page was not doing was explaining:</p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>1. The product’s name - there was no connection to this throughout the app</li>
                          <li>What the product was meant to do? </li>
                        </ol>
                  </div>
              </div>
            </div>
              <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12">
                  <div class="right-content">
                    <a target="_blank" href="assets/images/oldlp.png">
                    <img src="assets/images/oldlp.png" alt="Old Landing Page">
                    <p>Header of the old Landing Page</p>
                  </a>
                  </div>
              </div>
          </div>
          <br>

          <p>Another thing I noticed was that once the user selected the template and started editing it, they were not able to save their progress in case the page refreshed, they lost internet connection, etc.</p>
          <p>As the user is browsing through the product, each page looks similar to one another and they couldn’t filter or search through the templates to find anything specific. They would have a difficult time finding the latest templates, or featured templates. With the current state, they would have to manually look to discover them. </p>
          <p>Another area users would come look into were how-to sections (e.g., how to create a Facebook cover?, etc.). Before we iterated, we did not have a how-to section which also made it difficult for users to use the product itself. There was no information available of what are the sizes for the posts for each social media platform, as well as no information on how they can use our editor to create that and make it unique to their brand.</p>

          <br>
          <p style="font-weight:bold; color:#32a8a8;font-size:16px;line-height:20px;">Competitive Analysis</p>
          <p>Due to the project being still under an NDA, I am currently inclined to share our findings for a competitive analysis as it is still an ongoing project. </p>
          <br>
          <br>

          <p style="font-weight:bold; color:#32a8a8;font-size:16px;line-height:20px;">Key Touchpoints</p>
          <ol>
            <li>1. Users could not tell the product was by Shopify, resulting in a lower engagement as the tool seemed incomplete</li>
            <li>2. Users did not have the ability to save their work in progress</li>

          </ol>
          <br>

 <h2>Ideation - Brainstorming and Iteration</h2>
<br>
  <p>Looking at the feedback I received, I decided to map out the basic user flow of the landing page to the editor. With the team, we discussed on making a quick MVP of user accounts that connects to Shopify identity where users can save their drafts and come back to it when they are ready. </p>

  <p>Another thing we discussed was how might we be able to make the look and feel of the product more related to Shopify? The reason we were targeting this is because we believed that if this tool is being used for acquisition, there definitely needed to be a better story on how users got to Shopify without having to insert ad-like CTAs throughout the product. </p>
  <p>Working with the marketing designers, we decided to look at the other tools Shopify has to offer, which act like an extension to Shopify. The reason we wanted to keep it as an extension was so that it can be its own stand-alone product where we can test the requirements that merchants need before joining the core platform. This included the strategy on how we can help them increase their traffic to their social media platforms and create a brand that their customers trust. </p>
  <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12">
          <div class="left-text-content">
              <div class="section-heading">
                <p>Creating a visual identity for Taler was very important. We started off by using all the Shopify components available to us, and then slowly iterating on them to make them look more as an extension. All the colours chosen were already part of Shopify's brand, but were not the primary colours used.</p>
                </div>
          </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12">
          <div class="right-content">
            <a target="_blank" href="assets/images/talercolour.png">
            <img src="assets/images/talercolour.png" alt="Brand Colours">
            <p>Brand Colours for Taler</p>
          </a>
          </div>
      </div>
  </div>

<p>The reason we decided to have one of our primary colours as black is due to the nature of our editor. Currently, Taler is using an third party SDK library to be able to control the editor, which means that it cannot be changed from dark mode. Due to that nature, and to make the transition from the landing page to editor more consistent we decided to use black. </p>
<p>When it came to the main layout of the landing page, we decided to showcase our brand taler. Working with a content designer, I created the landing page to showcase what our primary features are, how the users can interact with it, as well as the next steps. </p>

  <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12">
          <div class="left-text-content">
              <div class="section-heading">
                <p>Besides the visual identity, we needed to start promoting the tool was by Shopify to help increase the level of engagement and also help in its SEO ranking. One of the things we iterated on was how might be incorporate the Shopify logo onto the landing page. The current solution that we had with the “powered by Shopify” logo, made it seem like we were a merchant using Shopify’s platform to create this tool. So, to avoid that confusion with the brand and marketing designers we created a new logo. </p>
                </div>
          </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12">
          <div class="right-content">
            <a target="_blank" href="assets/images/talerlogo.png">
            <img src="assets/images/talerlogo.png" alt="New taler logo">
            <p>New Taler Logo</p>
          </a>
          </div>
      </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12">
          <div class="left-text-content">
              <div class="section-heading">
                <p>Since the experiments main goal was to start helping users get onto the Shopify platform, we also decided to use Shopify’s login process to make the transition easier. We started off by seeing how a user might create an account. Considering our product is very new, we decided as a team that it might be better to allow the user to first use our editor and then decide whether they want to create an account with us or not. So, once they are satisfied they would want to download their product which is when our signup modal will appear to signup for a free account. The reason we chose Shopify identity was when the user created their account, they can easily take their assets and publish it onto their online store or marketing campaigns. </p>
                <p>Unfortunately, with the way Shopify identity works, we could not find a way to allow users to input an email and password directly onto Taler and create a Shopify identity account. The user would need to go to an external and page and be redirected back to Taler once they are done.</p>

              <h2>Improvements</h2>
              <br>
              <p>There are many things that I hope to improve within this product, such as with more time we will be able to make this product stronger and hopefully have a better flow with Shopify where merchants and non-merchants can both discover and use the app. </p>
              <p>Another thing that I would improve once we have more time is how we redirect to Shopify identity when creating an account by creating more banners that showcase the user is being directed, or finding a better solution that we can avoid the redirection completely.</p>
              <p>Since this is an acquisition tool, I would also focus on how we can do a better job at explaining what Shopify is and what it has to offer before they get redirected. </p>
